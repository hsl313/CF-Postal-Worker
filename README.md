# CF Postal Worker

This is a project using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and leveraging [Cloudflare Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/) to enable you to send information to your email by calling the Worker's API. You don't need an email server or third-party email forwarding services, and you don't have to maintain a database or develop a backend.

Use cases:
- If you have a static web project and don't want to develop a backend or manage a database, you can integrate a contact form and directly send the information to your email.
- Other scenarios that require forwarding messages to an email.

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- A domain name (you can register the cheapest domain on Cloudflare)
- If deploying via the command line, you need to have Node.js environment installed locally.
